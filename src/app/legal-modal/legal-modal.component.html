          <p>
            All jewelry pieces offered by Madame Pearls are handcrafted using authentic volcanic stones sourced from 
            Santorini, Greece. Each piece is unique due to the natural variations in the volcanic stones.

            We strive to accurately represent our products through images and descriptions, however, natural stone 
            variations mean your piece may differ slightly from the photographs shown.
